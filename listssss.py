# Here is more what I was looking for...

# You could store your cars in a list like this
# car = [2019, 'Honda', 'Accord']
# So then if you wanted to store more than one car you can have a list of cars like this
cars = []
# And then when you make a new car you can say cars.append(car)

#I want you to first ask me how many cars I want to make
count = input("How many cars would you like to make?")

# Can you fill out the rest? Hint: use a while loop to make new cars.

# When you're done you can print out the list of cars like this to verify it works. we can worry about printing it nicely in the next task
print(cars)
